## Latest Updates
- **February 2025**: Initial release of the code and paper for glacial lake segmentation using DeepLabV3+, U-Net, and YOLOv8-Seg.

## Abstract
Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a severe risk to populations in high-altitude areas, particularly in Pakistan's northern regions. This paper focuses on using Deep Learning (DL) models for detecting and segmenting glacial lakes to mitigate GLOF risks. Using the Glacial Lakes Detection Dataset from High-Mountain Asia, we evaluate DL models like DeepLabV3+, U-Net, and YOLOv8 for lake segmentation and classification. Experimental results demonstrate the proficiency of these models, with DeepLabV3+ (ResNet50 backbone and Dice loss function) achieving the highest IoU score of 77.2%.

## Introduction
- **GLOF Risk Reduction**: This project leverages advanced deep learning models to segment and classify glacial lakes in satellite imagery, enabling early detection of GLOF risks.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Evaluation of state-of-the-art DL models (DeepLabV3+, U-Net, YOLOv8-Seg) for glacial lake segmentation.
  - High IoU scores achieved, with DeepLabV3+ (ResNet50 + Dice Loss) reaching 79.2%.
  - A comprehensive dataset of 1,200 cloud-free Sentinel-2 images with ground truth masks.
